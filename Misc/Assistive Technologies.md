### Perception - hearing, feeling, and seeing

**Refreshable Braille display**
A mechanical terminal that displays a line of [Braille](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#braille) characters (usually 40-80) by raising and lowering the dots (pins) dynamically. Braille devices with capabilities of small computers incorporate Braille displays. These devices can be used to take notes, calculate numbers, or to interface with other devices such as public information kiosks.

**Screen reader**
Software that processes content on the desktop and in web browsers, and converts it to others forms such as [text-to-speech](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#tts) and [Braille](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#braille). Screen readers typically provide other functions such as shortcut keys, different modes for processing content and interacting with it, and the ability to highlight the text that is being read aloud.

**Voice browser**
Similar to [screen reader](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#sr) but usually only processes web content. Voice browsers are typically not developed as assistive tools but as alternative web browsers for mobile devices or similar.

### Presentation distinguishing and understanding

**Reading assistants**
Software that changes the presentation of content and provides other functionality to make it more readable. Examples include:
 - Customising the font type, size, spacing, or foreground and background colours;
 - Scanning the text for complex words and phrases, and linking them to glossaries;
 - Hiding less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and header areas;
 - Providing outlines of the page headings and summaries of the text passages;
 - Reading the content aloud and highlight the text as it is being read out loud.

**Screen magnifier**
Software used primarily by people with partial sight to enlarge the

### Input typing, writing, and clicking

**Accelerators**
Software and functionality that help reduce the effort needed to type or click. For example, by providing options to create shortcuts for commands or sequences of commands, by highlighting selection choices such as menu items, links, or options, and by helping to steer the mouse.

**Alternative keyboard and mouse**
Hardware and software primarily used by people with cognitive and physical disabilities to help interact with the computer. Examples include:
    -   Keyboards with larger keys, key labels, key spacing, illuminated keys, or custom layouts;
    -   On-screen keyboards, touch-screens, sip-and-puff switches, and single-key switches;
    -   Trackballs, joysticks, touchpads, specially designed mice, and other pointing devices;
    -   [Voice recognition](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#voice), [eye tracking](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#gaze), and other approaches for hands-free interaction.

**Eye tracking**
(sometimes called “eye-gaze”)
A system that monitors eye movement to control the mouse pointer and detects blinking to initiate mouse clicks.

**Keyboard customisation**
Includes changing the mapping of keys, assigning shortcut keys to functions, setting [filters](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#filters), and setting “sticky keys” to support single-handed typing.

**Keyboard and mouse filters**
Functions of the operating system or software tools that recognise and compensate for involuntary movements such as tremor and spasms.

**Mouse customisation**
Includes changing the mapping of buttons, changing the sensitivity of the mouse towards movement, setting [filters](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/#filters), and changing the size and appearance of the mouse pointer.

**On-screen keyboard**
Virtual keyboard displayed on a screen so that it can be used with a touchscreen, mouse, trackball, joystick, or other pointing devices.

**Spelling and grammar tools**
Web browser functions, plug-ins, or other software tools to help users write.

**Voice recognition** 
(sometimes called “speech input” or “voice command”) 
Software that recognises the human voice and can be used to dictate text or to issue commands to operate the computer.

**Word prediction**
Software that presents selections of matching words, phrases, or sentences based on the current input (and sometimes context) to save typing.
