## Roles and patterns

[ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) (APG) has examples of different [roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) along with required keyboard controls and [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes)  as well as examples of common patterns that do not have a defined role, like Accordions. This site also has good resources about landmarks and labels.

The first place to go when building new components to make sure they are built in an accessible way.
