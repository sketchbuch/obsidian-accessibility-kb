# Tooltip Role

A tooltip is a contextual text bubble that displays a description for an element that appears on pointer hover or keyboard focus.

## Notes

- Should not contain focusable content, just text. Screen Readers will just convert everything to text.
- Should not be a button, it is designed to appear on focus/hover.
